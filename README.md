# Personal-Voice-Assistant-
I have created voice assistants using  libraries like smtplib, wikipedia, web browser and speech recognition in python.


I have implemented my own Personal Voice Assistant like Jarvis. Voice Assistant was able to do things which include:

1) First of all wish you with respect to time.
2) Speaks a string
3) Convert voice to string
4) Speaks data by getting from wikipedia
5) Opens google, youtube, stackoverflow
6) Runs music from directory randomly
7) Speaks current time
8) Opens a software i.e. mozilla
9) Email to user
10)Quits software
